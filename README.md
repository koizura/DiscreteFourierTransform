# Discrete Fourier Transform Algorithm

Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video, "But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction." (https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY), I decided to remake the DFT algorithm!


I included a few sound files. Modify minim.loadFile() in the code to change which sound file to play.
- "440hz.mp3" a simple pure 440hz tone
- "ghostchoir.mp3" a beautiful song by Louie Zong. The tones are really clean so they make a great visualization! 
- "intothespiral.mp3" a jazz piece by Fox Capture Plan.


# Setup
Interested in running this program?

1. Download Processing (java) from https://processing.org/
2. run `git clone https://github.com/koizura/DiscreteFourierTransform` in the command line
3. open `fourierTransform.pde` in the Processing editor
4. add the Minim library to by navigating to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library, and search for Minim and install.
5. Hit play, and hopefully everything works :)
